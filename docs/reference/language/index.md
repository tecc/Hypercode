# Language

This part of the reference documentation covers how the Hypercode programming language works.

A Hypercode compiler must be compliant with this specification in such a way if a compliant compiler was to compile the same code as the former compiler, the code would produce the same result.
This does not mean that the compiler must produce the same template as the compliant one, but the templates must evaluate to the same result when executed.
